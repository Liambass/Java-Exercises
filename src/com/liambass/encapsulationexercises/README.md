1) Create a new class call Encapsulation with 5 variables (one String, one integer, one double, one float and one long).
2) Encapsulate your variables (make them private and generate getters and setters).
3) Generate two constructors - one should be empty.
4) Use setters to set values in your Runner.java.
5) Use getters and System.out.println(); to print out the values in your Runner.java.
6) Generate toString in your Encapsulation.java and invoke it from Runner.java.
