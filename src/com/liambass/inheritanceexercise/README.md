- Design a class named Person and two subclasses named Banker and Farmer.
- Every person should have some generic attributes (e.g. name, age) and functionality (e.g. eat, sleep).
- The Banker and Farmer subclasses should also have attributes and functionality unique to them.
- The two subclasses should have their own custom constructors to set any relevant values.
- The two subclasses should also override a method from the Person class and implement it differently.
- All three classes should override the toString() method in order to print some useful information about the class.
- The Subclass toString() methods should include the same information as Person, but with their own unqiue info on top.
- Use encapsulation - private class variables with getters & setters.
- Use a separate runner class with a main method.
-----------------
- Read through community module on Polymorphism
- Have a go at testing polymorphism on your classes from yesterday.
- E.g. Create 3 instances of Farmer, stored as Object, Person and Farmer.
- Experiment with method access and casting to access methods.
