- Write a method that calculates the largest prime factor of a given number
-------------------------------
- Create a method that takes a number 10-99, and adds the two digits together for example 74 = 7 + 4 = 11.
- Create a second method that when given the number 1-99 returns a String representation of this number, for example 1 = one, 11 = eleven, 21 = twenty-one.
- Expand on the method you wrote in Numbers 2 to allow the input 1-999.
- Expand the method you wrote in Numbers 2 to allow the input 1-9999
- Use a for()-loop to print the numbers 1-100 in words. For example; 1 = one, 100 = one hundred.

- Recreate the following flowcharts (000.png and 001.png)
-----------------
- The Greatest Common Divisor of two positive integers is the largest integer that divides both without remainder. Write a method that returns the Greatest Common Divisor of p and q.
------------------
- Given a cost and an amount, work out the change given in specific coinage.
- For example; the cost is £4.58 and the customer pays with a £20 note so as change they receive:
```
1 £10 note
1 £5 note
2 20p's
1 2p
```
